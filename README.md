### QSAR Model for Predicting Acetylcholinesterase

Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) is a neurotransmitter that has been a popular pharmacological target, and inhibitors have shown to be effective in treating the symptoms of <b>Alzheimer's disease.</b> Alzheimer's disease is a neurologic condition in which the brain shrinks (atrophy) and brain cells die. Alzheimer's disease is the most prevalent cause of dementia, which is characterized by a progressive loss of cognitive, behavioral, and social abilities. <b>Cholinesterase</b> is a family of enzymes that catalyzes the hydrolysis of acetylcholine (ACh) into choline and acetic acid, which is required for a cholinergic neuron to return to its resting state after activation (and plays a key role in the pathogenesis of AD). Cholinesterase are of two types - Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and Pseudocholinesterase (BuChE).
--> The active class is denoted by '0'
--> Inactive class is denoted by '1'

#### The Objective of this project is to build a machine learning model for predicting the activity of Acetylcholesterase inhibitors
